**Unit 5: Conflict Management and Negotiations** <span id="5"></span> 
*Conflict is a good thing – as long as it is productive. Insulting
someone is not productive, but a healthy debate is the foundation of
democracy and is valuable in business as well. Successful organizations
encourage healthy conflict; it forces people to defend opinions and
allows for a free flow of ideas. (Of course, managers must prevent these
conflicts from getting out of hand.)*  
  
 *The same ideas apply to negotiation, or conflict with an individual
outside of the organization. The key to successful negotiation is
preparation. Whereas conflict within a firm can be less formal,
negotiations require much more due diligence. Whether it is a $10,000
contract or a $10 billion merger, the principles of negotiation remain
the same.*
