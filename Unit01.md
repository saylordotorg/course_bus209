**Unit 1: Organizations in Business** <span id="1"></span> 
*Let’s start with the basics in considering the following question: what
is an organization? An* organization *is a collection of individuals
arranged in a particular way and embedded in an ever-changing
environment in order to achieve a common goal. In this introductory
unit, you will learn about organizations in business, focusing on how
the individual plays a role in the success of the organization. You will
learn that you must understand what influences individual behavior
before you can study how individuals interact with organizations.* *As
in psychology and sociology, the individual person is the focus of
organizational behavior. Because sciences like psychology and sociology
are older, more established fields of study than organizational
behavior, we will take a look at them in order to better understand the
purpose and applications of OB. This unit will provide you with an
introduction to OB, including the history and emerging trends of OB. In
addition, we will identify the micro-level factors that contribute to
our understanding of the OB field. You will also learn about how OB is
connected with other sciences. Finally, you will be provided with
information on how to properly evaluate research in OB.*
