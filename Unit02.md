**Unit 2: Managing Individuals** <span id="2"></span> 
*Organizational behavior focuses on how individuals interact within a
firm. As you know, different incentives motivate and influence
individuals; some people strive for success or social status, others
just like to keep busy, and still others are focused on simply making
money. These are important differences to consider if you are at the
helm of a business, as it may influence the ways in which you motivate
your workforce.*  
  
 **In this unit, you will explore individual personalities and learn
what inspires people to want to succeed in the workplace. You will learn
the tools used to identify these traits and recognize that certain
traits, such as the ability to handle stress, are more desirable than
others* – *say, a sense of humor* – *in a work setting. Note that
different organizations will value traits differently. For example,
perhaps your organization values a sense of humor more! Knowing these
traits and how to identify them in people will greatly enhance the
success of a business.**
