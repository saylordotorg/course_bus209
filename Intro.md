Course Syllabus for "BUS209: Organizational Behavior"
-----------------------------------------------------

There is no shortage of quotes in which inspirational business leaders
describe the sources of their success. Their reasons are often diverse,
but almost everyone comes back to the same thing: people. The people
*are* the company; they create the success. In BUS301: Managing Human
Capital, you learned how to find, train, and manage these people. Please
keep in mind that there is more to successful business leadership than
managing human capital. You must have a suitable structure and culture
at your firm in order to achieve success. Imagine the U.S. military; it
boasts some of the best-trained soldiers in human history, but that
talent would be wasted without a structure designed to appropriately
deploy forces. In other words, the military would not be as successful
without streamlined organizational behavior. Organizational behavior
(OB) is the study of how people interact in organizations. These
interactions are governed by a number of factors, including your
personal life, the personality of your boss or your boss’s boss, a
direct report, the team you have been assigned to, or the direction that
the top of the organization has given to you. OB researchers carefully
monitor these dynamics within an organization, because any time there is
friction, money is lost. A certain level of friction is to be expected
(and often even desired), but most of the friction that occurs within an
organization is counterproductive and detrimental to the bottom line. In
this course, you will study the factors that have the greatest impact on
organizational behavior. From managing individuals and understanding
group dynamics to managing conflict and initiating change,
organizational behavior affects everyone in a firm. Some of this
material will overlap with BUS301, but all of business is
cross-functional; stretching concepts across subjects is a powerful
learning tool. This course will cover five major OB areas including
managing individuals, managing groups, power and politics, conflict
management, and organizational change. Before delving into more rigorous
content, it is important to understand what an organization is and the
history of organizational behavior as a discipline. In taking this into
consideration, this course will begin with a look at the basics of an
organization.

### Course Information

Welcome to BUS209: Organizationl Behavior. General information on the
course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the following
materials:  

-   [*Organizational
    Behavior*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Organizational%20Behavior.pdf)
-   [*Principles of
    Management*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Management.pdf)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
study the readings, lectures, and PowerPoint presentations in each
unit.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **120.75
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 16 hours. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete the introduction to
subunit 1.1 and subunit 1.1.1 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday night;
subunits 1.1.2 through 1.1.4 (a total of 3.25 hours) on Tuesday night;
etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As you read and view lectures, take comprehensive
notes, marking down any important concepts, definitions, etc. These
notes will serve as a useful review as you prepare and study for the
Final Exam.
