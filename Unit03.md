**Unit 3: Managing Groups** <span id="3"></span> 
*Is there a difference between a group and team? Certainly, for example,
groups can exist without having a specific goal in mind. Or said another
way, groups can have a goal that fluctuates or changes to adapt to the
needs of the group. A book club is a group. The people with whom you
discuss that month’s reading are not, however, part of your team. To
have a team, you must have a clear and elevating goal which supersedes
all individual goals. Usually, this goal does not change or get
adjusted; instead, it guides all aspects of the team’s performance. This
does not mean there is no place for groups within a company; many groups
exist to serve other needs within the organization. You might, for
example, have a committee for enhancing diversity in some way or a group
of executives that are searching for a new CEO. In both of these
examples, there is a goal (e.g. increase diversity or find a CEO), but
the way this goal is attained can change throughout the process. Perhaps
your group decided mid-way through the process to only consider internal
hires for the promotion as opposed to conducting an external search when
the group was first formed. Whether you are working with a group or a
team, there are several characteristics that successful groups and teams
share, including proper group development, the establishment of
guidelines and boundaries, leadership, and strong communication
channels.*  
  
 **In this unit, you will learn about these topics and more. Because so
much of business success relies on teams and groups, learning how to
properly manage them may be the most important takeaway from this
course.**
