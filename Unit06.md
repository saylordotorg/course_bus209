**Unit 6: Managing Change** <span id="6"></span> 
*Change is a surprisingly difficult process for firms. When two large
companies merge, it can take a couple of years to reorganize and many
more years before the two respective cultures truly merge. This
transition process can be especially challenging if the cultures are
very different. For example, if a southern bank purchases a bank based
in the northeast, the two different banking styles could wreak havoc
within the organization, as the southern company may rely on customer
service and slow growth, whereas the northern bank prefers an aggressive
strategy. Such mergers happen regularly, and OB specialists are involved
in the process from the start. In cases like this one, the structure of
a firm’s management is just as important as its culture. Will the two
banks continue to operate with a decentralized format, or will they have
all of senior management in one location? What are the advantages and
disadvantages of doing it one way or another? And of course, the most
difficult aspect of managing change is implementing it in the first
place. Humans are naturally resistant to change; making changes in an
organization is no exception.*
