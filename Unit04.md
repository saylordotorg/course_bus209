**Unit 4: Leveraging Power** <span id="4"></span> 
*Power is a popular topic, because it is so easily misused. We all have
some kind of power over others, whether it is earned through a promotion
in the organization or just a reflection of knowledge and experience.
This unit may alter your understanding of power and teach you that there
is nothing wrong with using power (appropriately). In fact, as an
employee, you are expected to use the power you have within an
organization as you were likely employed for just that reason.* *Power
comes in many forms, but it is almost always used to influence.*  
  
 **This unit will discuss how influence differs from manipulation and
explain how individuals use influence within the workforce. This unit
will conclude with a look at the politics within organizations and how
ethics apply to power. As you are likely aware, there are too many
examples in which power is used improperly in business. Responsible
business schools today place extra emphasis upon ethics, especially when
talking about subjects such as power.**
